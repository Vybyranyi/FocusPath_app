 * What became of the plans you published.

 * This is the minimum the feature owes an author, not a courtesy. Publishing is
 * otherwise write-only: anonymous by default, no author statistics in public,
 * and no notifications anywhere in this app — so without this page there is no
 * way at all to learn that a plan of yours helped anyone.
 *
 * Opening it is also the second of the two lazy triggers for the proven badge:
 * someone who stopped marking days on day 85 never fires the first one, and
 * their plan may still have earned it.
