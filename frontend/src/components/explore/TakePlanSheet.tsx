/**
 * Taking a plan.
 *
 * The start date is asked for rather than assumed: the schema refuses a start
 * in the past, so a silent "today" would be the only date that ever worked and
 * would still be wrong for anyone planning to begin on Monday.
 *
 * The length may be changed, and the sheet says plainly what that costs — a
 * clone of a different length no longer matches the plan and drops out of its
 * statistics. Someone who did 30 days of a 90-day plan did not walk that plan,
 * and letting their result count would poison the one number this library is
 * built on.
